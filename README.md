# What did the presidents say at their inaugurations?

![image](figs/title.jpg)

+ Projec title: Inauguration Speech
+ This project is conducted by Wanting Cui

+ Project summary: 

I believe most people know President Donald Trump's campaign slogan is "Make America Great Again.", but do you know this slogan was first used during President Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign. This slogan is later adopted by President Cliton for his campiagn, though it's never formly used as a campaign slogan. One slogan, using by 3 presidents from different parties, spanning over 3 decades is an interesting fact to consider.

Inauguration speech, alongside campaign slogan, delievers a president's political view and ideology. So, in this project, I would like to investigate how presidential speeches change through time and how they reflect different political preferences from two parties (Democrat and Reublican) in historial contexts.

Lengths, emotions, and topics are some important components of a speeach. So I would like to investigate these three aspects using beeswarm plots, sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
