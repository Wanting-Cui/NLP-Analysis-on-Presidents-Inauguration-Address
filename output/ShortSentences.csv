"13","And their success will be our success.","The snow was stained with blood.","And let us work until our work is done.","We are Americans.","We have given freedom new reach.","Vice President Johnson, Mr.","Suppose you go to war, you can not fight always;"
"34","Our country will thrive and prosper again.","For everywhere we look, there is work to be done.","You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus.","The Declaration of Independence flames with his eloquence.","To lower our voices would be a simple thing.","We dare not tempt them with weakness.","The Union is much older than the Constitution."
"17","Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.","We are the keepers of this legacy.","Across the world we see them embraced, and we rejoice.","We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it;","We have endured a long night of the American spirit.","let the oppressed go free.","The Constitution does not expressly say."

"33","We will not fail.","So it has been;","We can do no less.","We hear much of special interest groups.","Greatness comes in simple trappings.","This much we pledge--and more.","Physically speaking, we can not separate."
"39","We will make America safe again.","But know this, America: They will be met.","instead, we have drifted.","to stand by our side, not ride on our back.","I believe in them.","Let us never negotiate out of fear.","This is the only substantial dispute."
"16","And now, we are looking only to the future.","You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.","And ambition for a better life is now universal.","A man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly.","We achieve nobility in the spirit that inspires that use.","But let us never fear to negotiate.","The Constitution does not expressly say."
